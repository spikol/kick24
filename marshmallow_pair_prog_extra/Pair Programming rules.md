### Pair Programming

- A pair of programmers develop higher-quality software.
- It takes a little longer development time but much less time to find bugs afterward.
- Cosier and more fun than working alone.
- Improved knowledge sharing between programmers, less time spent on coordination
- Increased learning (and that's why you're here, isn't it?), you take turns teaching each other
- Otherwise, not pronounced knowledge and habits are exchanged.

### Pair Programming in Practice

#### Two programmers, one computer

- Driver - has hands on the wheel (keyboard) and eyes on the road (screen)

- Navigator - focuses on the destination and how to get there.

#### Rules
- You may not be commanding your partner. 
- The navigator may not touch the mouse or keyboard. 
- The driver may not ignore the navigator.
- You must swap roles often (e.g. every 20 minutes)
-  Try to keep a conversation going.

### Conversations between driver and navigator

- Good pair programming is not without communication and talk.
- Talk together as a pair all the time about what is happening on the screen.
- Reflect on what you have done and where you are going.
- The driver tells what they are doing and what is happening.
- The navigator comments to ensure they are doing the right thing and tells them what to do now and later.

#### Examples:

- Driver: "Now we create a new function to draw a sunflower." 
- Driver: "Now we test if XYZ works before we continue." 
- Navigator: "How can you do that?"
- Navigator: "Can you explain what you are doing?"
