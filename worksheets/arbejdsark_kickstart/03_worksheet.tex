\begin{exercisebox}[adjusted title=Functions]
Functions allow you to reuse the same code in multiple places,
name entire blocks, and add structure to code.\\

Open the Aquarium project. Add the following ``fish-draw-function'':

\begin{lstlisting}[language=JavaScript]
function setup() {
  createCanvas(400, 400);
  background(220);

  // basic fish shape
  fishX = 150;
  ellipse(fishX, 200, 120, 75);
  triangle(fishX - 60, 200, fishX - 90, 170, fishX - 90, 230);

  // eye
  eyeSize = 15;
  ellipse(fishX + 30, 190, eyeSize, eyeSize);
}

function draw() {}
\end{lstlisting}

Now it's much faster to fill the aquarium with fish and we avoid copying code.

\tcbsubtitle{Task:} Create your own \texttt{drawFish(x, y)} function that draws your entire fish with colour, fins and eyes.

\end{exercisebox}

\begin{exercisebox}[adjusted title=Green City continued]
Over in the electric car project, you can also try writing a function
to draw trees:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=JavaScript]
 function setup() {
  createCanvas(400, 400);
  background(220);
  drawTree(160);
}

function draw() {
  // we are going to use the draw function soon!
}

function drawTree(treeX) {
  fill(100, 100, 0);
  rect(treeX - 5, 350, 10, 20);
  fill(0, 200, 0);
  ellipse(treeX, 335, 40, 50);
}
\end{lstlisting}

\noindent
Structure your electric car project code with functions:
\begin{itemize}
\item Write a \texttt{drawCloud(x)} function that draws a cloud
\item Extend the \texttt{drawTree(x)} function to also accept a y-coordinate
\item Write a \texttt{drawCar(x)} function that draws a car
\item Write a \texttt{drawPowerplant()} function and a
  \texttt{drawWindmill()} function that draws the power plant and
  the windmill, respectively. We won't need to move them around, so they don't need to
  not take coordinates as an argument.
\end{itemize}
\noindent
Call all the functions in the \texttt{setup() }for now. For example:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=JavaScript]
drawTree(150, 235);
drawTree(240, 335);
drawPowerplant();
drawWindmill();
drawCar(50);
drawCloud(280);
\end{lstlisting}
