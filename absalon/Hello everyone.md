Hello everyone,

Welcome to the kickstart course in programming. In this course, you will learn the basics of programming in the p5.js programming language (JavaScript). We start from scratch, and most of the time will be spent on practical exercises and projects, where you will be at the keys and gain experience in writing code, structuring your code, debugging, and more.

We run the course comfortably and informally, and here's some good news: there will be homework between days. This will give you the freedom to focus on learning and exploring the world of programming with no assignment. There will also be time for you to get to know each other before the formal start of your studies in the following weeks.

I teach the course and eight skilled instructors who are themselves students on DIKU's courses:

Alexander, Thea, Jeppe, Mathilde, Casper, Andrea, Lucas and Viktoria.

When the course starts, you will be able to see the program for the individual days of the course via the buttons above - you can already see the weekly schedule.

For Kickstart 2024,  we have two one-week sessions. For week 33, 12-16 August and week 34 19-23 August

**Practical information:**

Kickstart is from **9:00 to 15:00** every weekday from Monday, August 12, to Friday, August 16 (u33)—there is no academic quarter, so come on time! We meet every morning at 9:00.

Place: The course is held at the **University of Copenhagen, Datalogisk Institut., Universitetsparken 5, 2100 Copenhagen.**

Good style on the kickstart course: To ensure you get the most out of the course and that it is a good experience for everyone, we have a few rules of thumb that we hope you will try to adhere to. See them here.

Teams: You have been divided into 4-5 teams in advance. Find your team in the Team Overview, where you can also see who your instructor is and which room you must be in.

**Please bring your laptop and get your KU account working before you arrive.**

**Lunch**—In August, it is best to bring food, as there are limited on-campus options. Some supermarkets are on Jagtvej, and other options (pizza, kebab, etc.) are available.
