Good style on the Kickstart course
For the course to be a good experience for everyone and for you to get the most out of the course, we have written a few rules of thumb that we hope you will try to adhere to:

1. There are no stupid questions, so don't hold back.
2. Get to know each other and help each other.
3. Try to participate actively, talk, and work with different team members.
4. Stay with your team for lunch or mingle with other teams.
