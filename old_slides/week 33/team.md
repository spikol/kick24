I hope you're doing well. I'm contacting you about your recent application for the Teaching Assistant role with us.

Unfortunately, we can't offer you the position this time around. It was a tough choice - we had many good candidates, and while your profile is impressive, others matched more closely with what we're looking for now.

Please don't see this as a negative reflection on your skills or potential. We really do appreciate your interest and the effort you put into applying.

Keep an eye out for future positions with us that might fit you better.

Best of luck with your search and future endeavours. Feel free to drop a line if you have any questions or need more feedback. We may have some opportunities. Please check https://di.ku.dk/ominstituttet/ledige_stillinger/, and you can contact me about research projects.

Best,
